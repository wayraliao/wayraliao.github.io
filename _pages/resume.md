## Profile
Research-oriented data scientist focusing on **Explainable AI (XAI)**, **data quality**, and **misinformation detection**. End-to-end experience from data acquisition and preprocessing to modeling, evaluation, and reproducible delivery.

## Core Skills
- **Languages/Tools:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, spaCy), Stata, SAS, Git, Jekyll
- **ML/NLP:** classification, topic modeling (LDA), text cleaning, model evaluation
- **Data:** Playwright/Selenium scraping, large-scale tabular & text wrangling
- **Other:** dashboards, reproducible pipelines, technical writing

## Experience
**Research Associate — National Taiwan University, Department of Economics**  
*YYYY–present, Taipei*  
- Built a text-mining pipeline for financial misreporting detection (10-K MD&A).  
- Engineered topic features and trained classifiers (logit / random forest / SVM), improving baseline AUC by **~8–12%**.  
- Maintained CFO-centric datasets (SEC filings, historical census); automated QA and versioning.  
- Authored reproducible notes and documentation for team handover.

## Selected Projects
- **CFO Misreporting Detection** — Topic features + ML; pipeline from cleaning to evaluation.
